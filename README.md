# Deep_Learning_and_TensorFlow_Tutorial

# Section 01
## In this Section, we're going to cover some of the most fundermental concepts of tensors using TensorFlow

More specifically, we;re going to cover,
* Introduction to tensors
* Getting information from tensors
* Manipulating tensors
* Tensors & Numpy
* Using @tf.function (a way to speed up your regular python functions)
* Using GPUs whit TensorFlow (or TPUs)
* Exercises to try for yourself!

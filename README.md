# Deep_Learning_and_TensorFlow_Tutorial

# Section 01
## In this Section, we're going to cover some of the most fundermental concepts of tensors using TensorFlow

More specifically, we're going to cover,
* Introduction to tensors
* Getting information from tensors
* Manipulating tensors
* Tensors & Numpy
* Using @tf.function (a way to speed up your regular python functions)
* Using GPUs whit TensorFlow (or TPUs)
* Exercises to try for yourself!

# Section 02
## Neural Network Regression with Tensorflow

Going to cover,
* Architecture of a regression model
* Input shape and outupt shape
    * `X`: Features/data(inputs)
    * `Y`: labels (outputs)

* Creating custom data to view and fit
* Steps in modeling
    * Creating a model
    * Compiling a model
        * Defining a loss function
        * Setting up an optimizer
        * Creating eveluation metrics
    * Filtting a model (getting it to find pattenns in our data)

* Eveluating a model
    * Visualizing the model
    * Looking at training curves
    * Compare predictions to ground truth(using the eveluatin metrics)

* Saving a model 
* Loading a model
